While there is no single endpoint to download a pre-generated report, you can programmatically access all the necessary data to build your own reports by using our **Statistics API**.

Please refer to the following endpoints to retrieve data for your reports:

-   [**Response Time History**](/api-reference/statistics/history): Get historical response time data for a specific domain.
-   [**Response Time Stats**](/api-reference/statistics/stats): Get aggregated statistics like average, min, and max response times.

By combining the data from these endpoints, you can create detailed and customized performance reports.
