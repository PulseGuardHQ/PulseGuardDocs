The PulseGuard API supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **Token-based authentication** via Laravel Sanctum (recommended)
2. **OAuth authentication** via popular providers (Google, GitHub, Discord)

## Token Authentication

All API requests use modern token-based authentication via Laravel Sanctum. You can generate and manage your API tokens on your [profile page](https://app.pulseguard.nl/profile) by clicking "API Tokens".

### Token Features
- **Named Tokens** - Give meaningful names to your tokens
- **Granular Permissions** - Control what each token can access
- **Multiple Tokens** - Create separate tokens for different applications
- **Secure Storage** - Tokens are securely hashed and stored
- **Easy Management** - View, create, and revoke tokens from your profile

## OAuth Authentication

For seamless integration, PulseGuard supports OAuth authentication. See the [OAuth guide](/api-reference/oauth) for detailed implementation instructions.

## Headers

All API requests must include the following headers:
- `Authorization`: `Bearer your_token_here`
- `Accept`: `application/json`
- `Content-Type`: `application/json` (for POST/PUT/PATCH requests)

## Example Request

Here is an example of how to make an authenticated request using `cURL`:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.pulseguard.nl/api/v2/domains" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \\
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```
