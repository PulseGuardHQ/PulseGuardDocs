description: 'How to authenticate with the PulseGuard API.'
---

The PulseGuard API uses token-based authentication via Laravel Sanctum. All API requests must include a valid authentication token.

You can generate and manage your API tokens on your [profile page](https://app.pulseguard.nl/profile) under the "API Tokens" section.

## Headers

All API requests must include the following headers:
- `Authorization`: `Bearer your_token_here`
- `Accept`: `application/json`
- `Content-Type`: `application/json` (for POST/PUT/PATCH requests)

## Example Request

Here is an example of how to make an authenticated request using `cURL`:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.pulseguard.nl/api/v1beta/domains" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \\
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```
