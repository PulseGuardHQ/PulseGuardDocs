PulseGuard provides automated security scanning to help you identify and mitigate common web vulnerabilities and misconfigurations for your monitored domains.

## How Security Scanning Works

For your monitored domains, PulseGuard can perform regular checks to analyze security headers, cookies, and perform vulnerability scanning. These checks run automatically, and the results are available in your domain's security report.
