PulseGuard can notify you about important events related to your monitors. You can fine-tune which notifications you receive and where you receive them.

## Configuring Notification Channels

First, connect the services you want to use for notifications.

1.  Navigate to **Account Settings** and then to the **Notifications** tab.
2.  Here you can connect integrations like:
    -   Email
    -   Slack
    -   Discord
    -   Telegram
    -   Webhooks
3.  Follow the instructions for each channel to connect it to your PulseGuard account.

## Setting Notification Rules

For each of your monitors (domains or devices), you can set specific notification rules.

1.  Go to the settings page for the specific domain or device.
2.  Find the **Notifications** section.
3.  Here you can specify:
    -   **When to notify**: For example, notify only when a monitor is down for more than 5 minutes.
    -   **Which channels to use**: Select from your configured notification channels. You can send certain alerts to Slack and others to email, for example.
    -   **Who to notify**: If you are part of an organization, you can choose to notify specific team members.

  Setting up smart notification rules helps to avoid alert fatigue while ensuring you never miss a critical issue.
