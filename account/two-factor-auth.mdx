Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account. When you log in, you'll need to provide both your password and a code from your authenticator app.

## Setting Up 2FA

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Security Settings">
        Go to your profile settings and click on the **Security** tab.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable 2FA">
        Click the "Enable Two-Factor Authentication" button.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Scan the QR Code">
        Scan the QR code with an authenticator app on your phone (like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enter the Verification Code">
        Enter the 6-digit code generated by your app to verify and complete the setup.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Save Recovery Codes">
        You will be shown a set of recovery codes. **Save these codes in a safe place.** If you lose access to your phone, you can use one of these codes to log in.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Logging in with 2FA

Once enabled, you will be asked for a code from your authenticator app each time you log in.

## Disabling 2FA

You can disable 2FA from the same **Security** tab in your profile settings. You will need to enter a code from your authenticator app to confirm this action.

<Warning>
Disabling 2FA will make your account less secure. We strongly recommend keeping it enabled.
