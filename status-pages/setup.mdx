Creating a status page is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to get started.

## Creating a Status Page

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Status Pages">
        From your dashboard, go to the "Status Pages" section in the sidebar.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create New Page">
        Click on the "Create New Status Page" button.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fill in Basic Information">
        - **Name**: A descriptive name for your status page (e.g., "PulseGuard Service Status").
        - **Slug**: A unique URL slug for your page (e.g., `pulseguard-status`).
        - **Description**: A short description of the services being monitored.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Save and Continue">
        Click "Save" to create the page. You will be redirected to the configuration options.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Options

Once your page is created, you can configure it to your needs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="paint-brush" title="Appearance">
    Customize the look and feel of your status page.
    - Upload your logo.
    - Set primary and background colors.
    - Add custom CSS for advanced styling.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Custom Domain">
    To use your own domain, you'll need to configure a `CNAME` record in your DNS settings to point to your PulseGuard status page URL.
    
    1.  **Add your domain**: Enter your custom domain (e.g., `status.yourcompany.com`) in the settings.
    2.  **Configure DNS**: Go to your DNS provider and create a `CNAME` record pointing from your custom domain to the PulseGuard URL provided.
    3.  **Wait for propagation**: DNS changes can take some time to take effect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="cubes" title="Components">
    Components represent the individual parts of your service that you want to display on your status page. You can link monitored domains or devices to these components.
    
    - Click "Add Component" to create a new one.
    - Give it a name (e.g., "Main Website", "API Endpoints", "Customer Dashboard").
    - Optionally, link it to an existing monitor in PulseGuard. The component's status will then be automatically updated based on the monitor's status.
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="bell" title="Notifications">
    Allow your users to subscribe to updates via email or other channels. You can configure which notification options are available.
