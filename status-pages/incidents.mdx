        Click "Create" to post the incident to your status page. Your subscribers will be notified.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating an Incident

As you work to resolve the issue, you should post regular updates.

1.  Go to the active incident on your status page dashboard.
2.  Click "Add Update".
3.  Change the **Status** if necessary (e.g., from `Investigating` to `Identified`).
4.  Provide a new **Message** with the latest information.
5.  Click "Post Update" to publish the new information.

<Note>
  Regular updates, even if just to say you're still working on it, build trust with your users.
</Note>

## Resolving an Incident

Once the issue is fully resolved and services are stable:

1.  Post a final update.
2.  Set the incident **Status** to `Resolved`.
3.  This will mark the incident as resolved on your status page and send a final notification to subscribers.
