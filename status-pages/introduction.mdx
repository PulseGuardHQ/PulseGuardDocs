## What is a Status Page?

A status page is a dedicated webpage that provides real-time information about the operational status of your services. It's the best way to communicate with your users during an outage, scheduled maintenance, or any other incident that affects service availability.

With PulseGuard, you can create beautiful, customizable status pages to keep your audience informed and build trust.
