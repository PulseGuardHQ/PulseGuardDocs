## Accessibility Scanning

PulseGuard also offers automated accessibility scanning for your own websites as part of our monitoring services. This helps you identify and fix accessibility issues on your own web pages, such as:

-   Missing alternative text for images
-   Insufficient color contrast
-   Lack of proper heading structure
-   ARIA attribute misuse

You can find the accessibility report in your domain's dashboard.
