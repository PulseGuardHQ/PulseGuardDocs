## Member Roles

PulseGuard has different roles to manage permissions within an organization:

-   **Owner**: Full access to the organization, including billing and deleting the organization. There can only be one owner.
-   **Admin**: Can manage members and resources.
-   **Member**: Can view and interact with resources they are given access to, but cannot manage settings or members.

## Managing Existing Members

From the "Members" tab, you can:

-   **See all members** and their current roles.
-   **Change the role** of an existing member.
-   **Remove a member** from the organization.
-   **Resend or cancel** pending invitations.
