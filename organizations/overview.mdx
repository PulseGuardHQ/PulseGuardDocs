PulseGuard's organization feature allows you to create a collaborative environment for your team. You can invite members, assign roles, and share access to monitored domains and devices without sharing your personal account credentials.

## Creating an Organization

1.  Navigate to your account settings.
2.  Go to the **Organization** tab.
3.  Click "Create Organization" and give it a name.

Once created, you become the owner of the organization and can start inviting members.
